### 💡 My Effort and Dedication
This portfolio was developed with a lot of effort and dedication, seeking to demonstrate my skills as a front-end developer. Some of the challenges I have faced and overcome include:

Integration with EmailJS: Implementation of a functional contact form that sends emails directly from the front-end.

Responsive Design: Creating an interface that adapts to different devices and screen sizes.

Code Organization: Use of best practices such as componentization, styled-components and ESLint to keep the code clean and organized.

I believe that this project reflects my ability to work with modern technologies and deliver high-quality solutions.
